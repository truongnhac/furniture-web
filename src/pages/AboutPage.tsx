          DEF Design Studio is a multidisciplinary practice based in Bao Loc, Lam Dong Province, Vietnam. Founded in 2018, we work across architecture, interior design and landscape to create environments that are deeply rooted in their context, culture and climate.
        </p>
        <p className="text-stone-600 leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">
          Our process is collaborative and detail-driven. We believe that great design emerges from listening — to our clients, to the landscape, to the materials we work with. Every project, regardless of scale, is approached with the same rigour and care.
        </p>
        <p className="text-stone-600 leading-relaxed text-base">
          From intimate residential interiors to large-scale public architecture, we are committed to crafting work that improves lives, enriches communities and stands the test of time.
